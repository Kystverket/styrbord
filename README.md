A (test) component library for React using Storybook

## Chakra-UI

We've added dependencies for [https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components). The intention is to wrap those components (as needed) and have an interface "controlled" by us.

This is similar to what Kartverket has done here: [https://kartverket.github.io/kvib/](https://kartverket.github.io/kvib/).

A simple wrap: [https://github.com/kartverket/kvib/blob/master/packages/react/src/checkbox/index.ts](https://github.com/kartverket/kvib/blob/master/packages/react/src/checkbox/index.ts)

A more complex wrap: [https://github.com/kartverket/kvib/blob/master/packages/react/src/button/Button.tsx](https://github.com/kartverket/kvib/blob/master/packages/react/src/button/Button.tsx)

We might do something in between.
